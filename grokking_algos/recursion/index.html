<p><code>recursion</code> is a module that introduces the high-level mechanics of the powerful and
elegant problem solving method we call recursion - in essence, a method of arriving to a result
by way of reducing a problem into smaller problems of the same general form.</p>
<h1 id="context" class="section-header"><a href="#context">Context</a></h1>
<p>We sometimes hear about recursion and recoil - imagining it is too hard, too abstract, or
too slow. There are reasons to put consider each of these critiques, but there are as many
reasons to dispel them.</p>
<p>For now, let's talk about recursion as a concept rather than the implementation (as with any
technique, application and implementation is everything if using it successfully!). Should
the question of proper usage of recursion or its merits be on the table - one only
has to ask, and I'll extol the benefits!</p>
<h1 id="mechanics" class="section-header"><a href="#mechanics">Mechanics</a></h1>
<p>Before we look at code or even pseudocode - let's identify the parts of recursion:</p>
<ul>
<li>A base case</li>
<li>A winding step</li>
<li>An unwinding step</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-base-case" class="section-header"><a href="#the-base-case">The Base Case</a></h2>
<p>The point at which the function must return, and the calling of itself is ceased. This is
typically the first part of your recursive procedure.</p>
<h2 id="the-winding-step" class="section-header"><a href="#the-winding-step">The Winding Step</a></h2>
<p>The point at which the recursive function is first called, ending with the entry into the
base case. The winding step involves no return statements, and so we traverse further into
the call stack, again and again - wound up like a ready to uncoil itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-unwinding-step" class="section-header"><a href="#the-unwinding-step">The Unwinding Step</a></h2>
<p>Usually this occurs just after the winding - it begins when the base case is hit, and
it ends when the very first call to the procedure finally returns.</p>
<p>We'll illustrate these steps further below in psuedocode.</p>
<h1 id="the-why-of-recursion" class="section-header"><a href="#the-why-of-recursion">The Why of Recursion</a></h1>
<p>So, why would one even want to use recursion over the iterative solution to a problem?</p>
<p>For some problems, the recursive solution is the natural one precisely because the problem is
naturally recursive. Evaluating the factorial of a value is a classic computer science
favorite for demonstration - though there are others, of course. Finding palindromes, the
greatest common divisor or evaluating the Fibonacci sequence, Ackermann's function, or
Pascal's triangle are still but a few.</p>
<p>Likewise, many data structures (and structures in the natural world) have recursive
properties - including, trees, graphs, and even the as-ever-useful list. Working
against them one may find they yield solutions most elegantly expressed recursively.</p>
<p>Familiar to almost anyone surely reading this - the filesystems on our computers and
portable devices is also an example of a recursive data structure!</p>
<p>Recursion can also be the correct approach to solve a problem in order to take advantage of
immutability. In fact, this close relationship with immutable data and recursion is central
to the paradigm of functional programming, with both of these fundamental qualities lending
to programs that can be far easier to reason about compared to their imperative counterparts.
Evidence suggests that recursion is often less error-prone and often of smaller code-size -
these benefits extend generally to the languages that rely on it, as well, including
GHC Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Scheme, F#, Agda, etc.</p>
<p>The downside to the usage of recursion is most often in its space requirements. As the recursive
calls are stacked one atop the other, memory is used; and, as memory is consumed, once there
is no further room for allocation we might have exhausted resources before arriving to
our solution.</p>
<h1 id="recursion-in-detail" class="section-header"><a href="#recursion-in-detail">Recursion In Detail</a></h1>
<p>Let's look at an example now
The pseudocode might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">my_recursive_procedure(my_arg):
    // This is the winding phase
    do_something_here_with(my_arg)

    // This is our base case
    if (length(my_arg) == 0):
        return a_value;

    // This is the recursive call + the start of the unwinding step
    my_recursive_procedure(my_arg_but_altered_to_ensure_we_will_converge_toward_base_case)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="exercises" class="section-header"><a href="#exercises">Exercises</a></h2>
<p>3.1</p>
<p>Suppose we have call stack that looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">| ----------- | ----------- |
|          Greet 2          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Name:       |   Winston   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|           Greet           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Name:       |   Winston   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
</code></pre>
<p>What can say about the current state of the call stack?</p>
<p>A - 3.1</p>
<p>We can determine that there are two functions on the stack: <code>Greet</code> and <code>Greet 2</code>.
Each takes at least a single parameter (<code>name</code>) having a value of <code>Winston</code>.
Both functions being on the stack would indicate that we in the middle of the
stack evaluation. Once <code>Greet 2</code> is called, we can expect that <code>Greet</code> will resume
its execution.</p>
<hr />
<p>3.2</p>
<p>Suppose you accidentally write a recursive function that runs forever. As you
saw, your computer allocates memory on the stack for each function call.
What happens to the stack when your recursive function runs forever?</p>
<p>A - 3.2</p>
<p>Because the stack is a limited resource - we are going to be headed toward a stack overflow!
This is absolutely not a good error to encounter - in fact, we often classify it as a
fatal error. Once we detect a stack overflow error, we cannot guarantee the integrity
of the program state and more often than not, our program has likely crashed completely.</p>
